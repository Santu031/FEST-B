## 🔍 What Happens on Vercel

When you deploy:

1. **Build Phase**
   - Vercel reads `package.json`
   - Installs dependencies
   - Validates `vercel.json`

2. **Deployment Phase**
   - Creates serverless function from `api/index.js`
   - Sets up routing `/api/*` → function
   - Applies environment variables
   - Generates HTTPS certificate

3. **Runtime**
   - Each API request runs the function
   - Auto-scales based on demand
   - Cold start ~100ms, warm ~10ms
   - Globally distributed

## 💡 Smart Features

### Automatic Scaling
- Handles 1 request or 1,000,000
- Pay only for what you use
- No server management

### Global Edge Network
- Deployed to 30+ regions
- Fast response times worldwide
- Automatic failover

### Zero Downtime Deployments
- New version deploys alongside old
- Instant switchover
- Rollback with one click
