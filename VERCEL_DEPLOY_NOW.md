## 🌟 Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Use Preview Deployments
Every `vercel` command (without `--prod`) creates a preview deployment. Test changes before going to production!

### Tip 2: GitHub Integration
Connect your repo to Vercel for automatic deployments on every push:
1. Push code to GitHub
2. Import project in Vercel Dashboard
3. Every push = automatic deployment

### Tip 3: Custom Domain
Add your own domain in Vercel Dashboard:
1. Project → Settings → Domains
2. Add your domain
3. Update DNS records
4. Done!

### Tip 4: Environment-Specific Variables
Set different values for Production/Preview/Development environments.
